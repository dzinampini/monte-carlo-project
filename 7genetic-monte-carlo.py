# Genetic algorithms (GA) are a search heuristic inspired by natural selection. They work by evolving a population of possible solutions (in our case, lottery number combinations) over several generations. The goal is to converge to an optimal or near-optimal solution.

# Steps to Implement GMC:
# Initial Population: Create a population of possible lottery number combinations (e.g., random sequences).

# Fitness Function: Evaluate how "fit" each combination is based on historical data (i.e., how often a combination of numbers appears).

# Selection: Choose the best-performing combinations for reproduction.

# Crossover: Combine pairs of selected combinations to create new offspring (new predictions).

# Mutation: Introduce random changes to offspring to maintain diversity.

# Termination: Repeat the process for several generations, then select the best-performing combination.
