# ðŸ§  SMC in Lottery Context:
# Each particle:

# Represents a 4-number sequence.

# Has a weight based on how similar it is to recent real draws.

# Is resampled at each iteration to favor high-weighted particles.

# Weâ€™ll:

# Initialize a population of random particles (number sequences).

# Define a likelihood function â€” how likely is a sequence, given historical data (e.g., based on number frequencies).

# At each step (iteration), sample particles based on weights and mutate them slightly.

# Return top-k predictions.
